# Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment analysis charts provide a visually informative way to track and understand shifts in sentiment over time. These data visualizations can offer insights into customer perceptions, brand reputation, market trends, and more.

With a little bit of customization and with the help of powerful AI technologies like Deepgram and Hugging Face, you can build your own sentiment analysis tool. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a sentiment analysis tool that produces beautiful charts to display the sentiment patterns of any audio clip.
